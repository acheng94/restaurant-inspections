        <p>Our goal is to incorporate yelp restaurant reviews with Las Vegas restaurant inspection results. A user will type a restaurant or type of food they want and that will output the reviews from yelp and the associated inspection results.</p>

        <div class="container">
        <p>As students, we frequently have to visit restaurants whether simply to stave off starvation while studying to odd hours at night, or socializing with friends and family. One of the most popular methods used to decide where to eat is to pull up the Yelp app and find a nice high-ranked nearby restaurant within a price range. However, eating outside comes with risk since a customer has no idea how the food was handled in the process of being created. Thus, we decided to try find a way to combine Yelp and health inspection results to allow users to find restaurants that are both popular and likely safer.</p>
